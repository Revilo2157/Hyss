# Hyss
Track your Spotify listens on a daily basis!

Read the instructions before proceeding.

Instructions:
1. Use https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers to create a docker container using Spyder. 
   DO NOT use eclipse. It will not be able to unzip the package. 
2. Press the monitor icon on the top right corner to connect to the virtual machine.
3. Download the files onto the virtual machine from this repository.
3. Use Spyder to run the SpotipySetup.py script to install the necessary packages.
4. Run the Hyss.py script and input the requested data onto the python console.
5. Sign in to spotify and copy the link you are redirected to. It should look like https://localhost.com
6. Go back to the console, add a space and paste the link you just copied.
7. You should see your ten most recent songs.
8. Enjoy!


If downloading from git does not work, download the files individually to avoid creating a .zip folder
